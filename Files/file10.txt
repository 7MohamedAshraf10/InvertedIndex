One of the famous volcanoes in Java is Mount Bromo, which attracts many tourists and photographers every year. Mount Bromo is part of the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, which covers an area of about 800 square kilometers and includes four other volcanoes and a large caldera called Tengger Caldera. Mount Bromo is active and often emits smoke and ash from its crater. The best time to visit Mount Bromo is during sunrise when you can witness the spectacular view of the sun rising over the misty landscape of the caldera and the surrounding mountains.
