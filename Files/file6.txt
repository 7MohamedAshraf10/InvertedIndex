Java supports multiple inheritance through a concept called interfaces.
 An interface is an abstract class that defines a set of methods without providing any implementation.
 A class can implement one or more interfaces and provide the implementation for the methods.
 This way, a class can inherit the behavior of multiple interfaces without having to extend multiple classes. 
Interfaces also allow for polymorphism, which means that an object can be treated as different types depending on the context.
