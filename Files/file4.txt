One of the most important tools for developing Java applications is the Java Development Kit (JDK). The JDK consists of a set of software components that include the Java compiler, the Java runtime environment (JRE), and the Java libraries. The JDK allows you to create and run Java programs on your computer. You can download the JDK from the official website of Oracle or from other sources online.
